# Learning Disentangled Representations via Mutual Information Estimation

This repository contains the code for the final project for the Deep Learning course @ UniVR. The code is based on [Learning-Disentangled-Representations-via-Mutual-Information-Estimation](https://github.com/MehdiZouitine/Learning-Disentangled-Representations-via-Mutual-Information-Estimation) an on the [paper of the same name](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03915) by Sanchez et. al. The code was adapted for using the [Shapes3D](https://github.com/google-deepmind/3d-shapes) dataset.

## Setup

The project was run on a commercial-grade laptop with an Intel i7-7500@2.70GHz CPU and an NVIDIA 940MX GPU with CUDA version 11.4.

The Shapes3D dataset needs to be downloaded and placed in a "cache" folder at the root of the repo. Training of the framework is shown in training.py Testing is shown in testing.py.
The report for the project is available in [Overleaf](TBD)
